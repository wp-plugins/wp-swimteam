
Welcome to the WordPress Swim Team plugin - wp-swimteam.

You can find the latest version of the plugin along with other
information on the plugin web site at:  http://wp-swimteam.sourceforge.net

This plugin was originally developed with WordPress version 2.3.3 - no
effort what so ever had been made to test it with prior versions of
WordPress.  It is now being developed with WordPress 2.6.2 but to the best
of my knowledge, should still work with 2.5.1 and possibly 2.3.3 but YMMV.

This plugin is installed in the same manner as any other WordPress
plugin - unzip it and upload it to the wp-content/plugin directory
and activate the plugin.  Once activated, the options must be set
before much can be done with the plugin.

NOTE: This plugin is completely depedent phpHtmlLib which must be
installed as a plugin or the wp-swimteam plugin will not work.

You can download phpHtmlLib from:  http://phphtmllib.sourceforge.net

At this writing, you need the development version of the 2_X branch
in order for the plugin to work correctly.  A new release of the 2_X
branch should be released in the near future.
