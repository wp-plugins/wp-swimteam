= 1.20 =
* Serious bug fix for Jobs module that could cause jobs to unintentionally be assigned, even for prior seasons.  Could result in a significant amount of e-mail.

= 1.19 =
* Fixed wp-SwimTeam so it will work in sub-directory installations and WordPress multi-site.
* Added new option to toggle message verbosity.  Some actions generate numerous messages, this option will reduce and summarize messages.
* Fixed Event Opt-In/Opt-Out which was broken with Event Model changes in v1.18.
* Added ability to load Meet Events from an Event Group into a swim meet.
* Fixed broken GUI controls for Events (expand, collapse, page forward and back).
* Tightened up flow control between Event Groups and Events and Swim Meets and Events.
* Changed buttons on for some actions (events, swim meets) to return to a logical place.  "Back" and "Home" didn't really mean anything in most cases.  In particular, "Back" has been a reliability challenge so in most cases it has been eliminated.
* Fixed several bugs in report generator which manifested themselves when User or Swimmer optional field count was set to zero.
* Fixed bug which resulted in broken Opt-In and Opt-Out actions on the drop down lists.
* Fixed bug which incorrectly entered Opt-In/Opt-Out information in Stroke format even when set for Event Mode.

= 1.18 =
* Fixed bug which prevented users from signing up for jobs.
* Phase 1 of overhauled Event Model is complete.  The new Event Model introduces the concept of Event Groups.  Events are now defined in the context of an Event Group.  Swim meets currently do not have any connection to Events but that will chance in a release fairly shortly in Phase 2.
* Added ability to import events from a Hy-tek Events File (.hyv) into an Event Group.
* Added ability to delete all events from an Event Group.
* Changed Google Maps API Key from required to optional.  If the API key hasn't been entered, wp-SwimTeam will now gracefully work without it.

= 1.17 =
* Fixed bug with unsupported action on Swimmer Tab introduced with changes to action bar in 1.16.

= 1.16 =
* Fixed another bug which caused display of "M/A" instead of first and/or last name in some instances.  Propogated this fix to a lower level class and eliminated duplicate code across numerous classes.
* Fixed inconsistencies across UI where some tabs had actions as drop downs and others had buttons.  All tabs now use the drop down UI model.

= 1.15 =
* Fixed bug which caused display of "M/A" instead of first and/or last name in some instances.

= 1.14 =
* Fixed odd use case where get_user_meta() sometimes returns an array with an empty string and other times returns an empty array.  This bug manifested itself with a PHP warning from the phpHtmlLib plugin which wp-SwimTeam references.

= 1.13 =

* Fixed bug which prevented display of first and last name is user list within the Swim Team and Manage menus.
